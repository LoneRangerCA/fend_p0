  <h1>First Project Details and Submission - Roger Grossman</h1>
  
  <h2>May I begin with a little history?  I was a software developer for, well, quite some time.  I was managing about 8 programmers when the internet bubble burst in 2002.  It was a relief.  I hated every minute I spent in front of a "computer terminal".  To make a long story short I am now a mostly happy Marriage and Family Therapist and Substance Abuse Counselor.  Well the world has changed in the last 14 years and the computer world is a whole new frontier.  I'm ready for a new challenge and maybe a change in career.  Again.</h2>

  <h3>Imagine that you are a month into your Nanodegree program and you&#x27re stuck. Totally stuck. You have no idea what&#39s wrong and you have no idea how to get yourself out of this mess.
You&#x27ll write a letter to yourself using what you&#39ve learned.  How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges?</h3>


<h4>I have a history of dysfunctional directory entries so the first thing I would do is verify the file dependencies are working correctly.
Next I&#39d try to form a Google search that would inform me on what I don&#39t know yet.
After that I&#39d look at the Udacity discussion forums to see if anyone else had the same problem or to steal the code (I&#39d make sure I know what it's doing and what I was doing wrong before I submit it.)

I&#x27ve been stuck with computer problems before.  Before the internet was invented.  Before tech support.  When there was nobody to help because, frankly, I was the best programmer on site.
Obviously I&#x27ll wind up learning the solution to the stuckness.  Hopefully I will have learned how to not get quite so stuck the next time.  And at some point I might come to some decision about what to do with the rest of my life.  Is that enough to get from a couple of coding logjams?</h4>

<h3>How will what you&#39ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?</h3>
<h4>There&#x27s an old saying.  "Change your mind and you can change the world."</h4>


<h3>Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals.</h3>

<h4>I work with parolees, street people, veterans, people who have sustained severe trauma.  I&#x27ve been doing it for 6 years.  I&#39m not burned out yet but I believe in having options and going back to being a developer sounds like a pretty good option.</h4>

<h3>Is there a dream job you&#x27re working toward?</h3>
<h4>Nope</h4>

<h3>Is there a project idea you&#x27ve been aching to start working on?</h3>
<h4>Nope.  I&#39ll take what comes.</h4>

<h3>Optional: In addition to your goals, we also want to know about any questions you have about the process of becoming a Front End Developer.
Is there anything about being a Front-End Developer that you&#39d like to know more about?</h3>
<h4>What&#39s the latest on working off-site with tech companies these days.  The 2.5 hours it would take me to commute to and from SF could be put to better use.</h4>
